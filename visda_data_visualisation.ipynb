    "### What is a Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualisations and narrative text. <br>\n",
    "Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualisation, machine learning, and much more. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What software do I need to work with Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "To work with Jupyter Notebooks using the python programming language, you first need to install Anaconda. <br>\n",
    "Anaconda is an open source distribution for the programming languages Python and R, which aims to simplify package management and software deployment. <br>\n",
    "You can install Anaconda by following the instructions of the [website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "After the basic installation of Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook should also be pre-installed. <br>\n",
    "Otherwise it can be installed according to the instructions on the [website](https://jupyter.org/install). <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "If you are a more advanced user with Python already installed and prefer to manage your packages manually, you can just use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter/). <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For this tutorial we will provide you a browser version, so you don't have to install anything.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of working with a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "Code parts or text contents are organised in sequential cells. This enables separate execution of each one. <br>\n",
    "This allows you to display intermediate results directly or to optimise individual sections of code without having to execute the entire source code each time. <br>\n",
    "You can also insert images or tables into the document. Double click on this cell to see how it works! <br>\n",
